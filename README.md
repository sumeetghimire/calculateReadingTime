# calculateReadingTime
This JavaScript package calculates reading time based on word count and font size. Unlike traditional methods, it adjusts for font size variations, providing a more accurate estimate. Simply pass an HTML element, and it returns the reading time for that text. Perfect for blogs and articles.
